        gg(green), bb(blue). Hexadecimal integer specify the components of the
        color. All values must be between 00 to ff.

        which has the following syntax rgb(red,green,blue).Each
        parameter(red,green,blue) defines the intensity of the color and can be
        integer b/w 0 to 255 or a percentage from (0% to 255%).

      <p class="rgba">
        RGBA color: It is almost similar to RGB format except that RGBA contains
        A (Alpha) that specifies the element's transparency. The value of alpha
        is in the range 0.0 to 1.0, in which 0.0 is for fully transparent, and
        1.0 is for not transparent. Syntax: color:rgba(R, G, B, A);
      </p>

      <p class="hSl">
        It is a short form of Hue, Saturation, and Lightness. Let's understand
        them individually Hue: It can be defined as the degree on the color
        wheel from 0 to 360. 0 represents red, 120 represents green, 240
        represents blue.Saturation: It takes value in percentage in which 100%
        represents fully saturated, i.e., no shades of gray, 50% represent 50%
        gray, but the color is still visible, and 0% represents fully
        unsaturated, i.e., completely gray, and the color is
        invisible.Lightness: The lightness of the color can be defined as the
        light that we want to provide the color in which 0% represents black
        (there is no light), 50% represents neither dark nor light, and 100%
        represents white (full lightness).Let's see the syntax of HSL in color
        property.
